# Predicting Used Vehicle Price ðŸš—
**The code is available [here](https://github.com/almosenja/data-science-projects/tree/main/Used%20Vehicle%20Project/notebooks)**

## Objective
In this project, I explored and deployed implemented a pipeline that consists of several stages:
- Exploring the dataset to find relationship between features.
- Conducted feature engineering such as transforming object types data into numerical and handling misisng values
- Compared different machine learning models.
- Make predictions on price using the best machine learning model.
- Find the most important feature based on model.

## Dataset
Dataset used in this project is from Craigslist which is the world's largest collection of used vehicles for sale. This data is scraped every few months, it contains most all relevant information that Craigslist provides on car sales including columns like price, condition, manufacturer, latitude/longitude, and 18 other categories.
